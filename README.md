# Borrower_reliability_study

!!This is my project made as part of the training in Yandex.Practicum!!

The client is the credit department of the bank. We need to understand whether the marital status and number of children of the client affects the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the potential borrower's ability to repay the loan to the bank.
